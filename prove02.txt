When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.

1. Please provide the URL of your public GitHub repository.

https://github.com/caleblj/CS450
2. Briefly describe your overall approach to the task and highlight the most difficult part of this assignment.
The project wasn't too difficult and there wasn't necessarily a "most difficult part". The only thing that took awhile
was getting the KNN algorithm correct by trial and error.

3. Briefly describe your process for handling numeric data on different scales (i.e., normalizing).
it was a matter of keeping the information for the sets saved in an array and then using a comparrison for the input and the
KNN algorithm. Using k to find a sum to find where the data stands.

4. Describe your results for the Iris data set. (For example, what level of accuracy did you see for different values of K?
My accuracy was around 90% every time. Occassionally it would change to a little higher but would stay very close to 90.

5. How did your implementation compare to existing implementations?
They were very similar. It was a matter of taking the code that was given and modifying it to fit the data that we were given.

6. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.
I mostly met the requirements to follow what was needed for an A but will be going back to add more into it.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

D
8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I have met the requirements and feel like my percentage is correct to what it should be.
